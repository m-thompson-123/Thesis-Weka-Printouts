# Thesis-Weka-Printouts
Weka printouts for the machine learning performed for the master's thesis entitled "The Accuracy of Machine Learning Algorithm Classification of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy Data for Geological Applications"

Naming Convention

Two data set names:\
Curiosity: Curiosity data set\
Rocks: mineral ore data set

For all:\
CV: 10-fold cross-validation\
%: 80% training, 20% testing data set split\
LibLINEAR: algorithm used\
Logistic: algorithm used\
MultlayerPerceptron: algorithm used\
Naive_Bayes: algorithm used\
RandomForest: algorithm used\
SMO: algorithm used

For the Curiosity code:\
Only_Ratios: only the ratios and the element wavelengths not involved in ratios as the data set\
Ratios: ratios and all twelve element wavelengths as the data set\
No data set specified: twelve element wavelengths as the data set\
Types: classified on geological type\
Location: classified on sampling location

For Rocks code:\
Area: classified on sampling location\
Binary: classified as from the DRC or not from the DRC
